# Neuron simulation
The code in this folder is a back port of the [Julia single neuron](https://github.com/wdevore/Deuron7-Julia) simulation to GoLang.

# Simulation
The simulation tests the functionality of the neuron and what range of parameters values the neuron is functional within.

The parameters are tuned against a given number of synapses. As the synapse count changes the neuron will need re-valuing.
